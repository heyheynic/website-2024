// This page is going to consist of several elements, I'm considering there will be seven sections of it. Each section should minimum take up about 100dvh.

// First and foremost, I will change things around in the header/navigation, making it unique for this page only. It'll only have the logo that will link to the homepage when clicking on it.

// First section will just be an introduction where it says "interactive resume"

// Second section will have a quick introduction of me, my name, location, and some sort of quote.

// Third section will have a big text, highlighting my passions

// Fourth section will have a longer text, just to get to know me better. It'll be surrounded by the assets I have created.

// Fifth section will show my "Toolbox", my "hard skills", and what language I speak.

// Sixth section will be where I share some projects I have been working on, portfolio etc.

// And last section will be the CTA, with links to socials and perhaps a form to contact me.
